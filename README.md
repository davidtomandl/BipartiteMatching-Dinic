BipartiteMatching-Dinic
=======================

Finds a maximum bipartite matching in a graph. Dinic's algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.
Everything is written in C++11.

<h2>How to use it? </h2>
Download the source files and include header files in your project.
Public methods and functions are described in the header files.
The library assumes correctly entered data.
